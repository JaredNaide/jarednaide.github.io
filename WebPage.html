Hi! My name is <b>Jared Naide</b>. I live in the great city of Athens, but I am originally from Johns Creek, Georgia. 
I have lived in Johns Creek my entire life, and grew up there with my mother, father, and sister. 
For most of my childhood, my family was really happy and satisfied with our ordinary lifestyle. 
My father and I would engage in more active activities such as tennis, basketball, bike riding, and video gaming. 
My mother, on the other hand,tried to enrich my learning with the arts, modern culture, and history.
I loved growing up with both of them because they always seemed to balance each another out.
However, my parents split up when I was 14. 
<s>To be candid, I was devastated and hurt by my parents.</s>
While this was an extremely difficult change in my life at the time, I was able to adjust.
As I matured and grew older, I learned and understood why it had to happen.
<em>And now, we have all moved on.</em>
My mother is remarried with a new husband, and my father is moving to DC for his new job. 
One individual who really helped me during the split was my sister (who is pictured above) as she truly understood everything that I was experiencing.
Although my sister is 3 years older than me,we are extremely close.
In fact, she was the one who inspired me to apply to UGA as that was where she enrolled.
She graduated this past year and has found professional success with a new internship. 
While we may have suffered hardship as a result of the divorce, I am so glad that now we are all in a much better place.
</p>

As for myself, I am an aspiring double major with psychology and intended marketing as my areas of interest.
When I first arrived at UGA, my advisor suggested I pick my major in her words<q>ASAP</q>.
However, it took me a while to decide on my majors of interest as there are many areas of study to choose from. 
Back when I was at Johns Creek High School, I wound up taking a variety of courses as I had passion for multiple subjects
With my two selected majors, I finally feel that my academic and professional careers have direction. 
During freshmen year, I lived in Brumby Hall.
Although freshmen year will always be my favorite and the most memorable, <strong>I am extremely thankful to have moved out of Brumby.</strong>
This year, I live in Tau Epsilon Phi, which is a fraternity house located in Greek Circle. 
Surprisingly, the house is much cleaner in comparison to Brumby.
My social life this year has flourished with having date nights, socials, and formals.
In addition, I have been able to maintain my work ethic while living in-house.
Having the opportunity to live in Greek Circle has been amazing, and I am so fortunate to have such incredible friends and brothers. 
While it'll be very upsetting to leave, I am excited to live in Whistlebury next year with some of my closest friends.

Aside from UGA, I have other pastimes, hobbies, and friends from home. 
As you can see in the pictures above, I am a huge fan of music festivals and events. 
My ideal vision of a perfect night is attending one of these festivals with my close group of friends where we are just listening and enjoying the music together.
Some of my other activities and hobbies I participate in are playing tennis, rock climbing, spending time with family, reading, watching TV, and being together with my friends.
Specifically, my favorite television show has to be <i>American Horror Story</i>.
The reason being is that show has very strong story arcs, plots, and twists that keep you guessing until the very end.
My values are also very important to me.
There are certain qualities that I value in my loved ones and look for when meeting new people.
I appreciate people who are loyal, honest, funny, intelligent, trustworthy, and insightful. 
It bothers me when people lie, use other people, or betray others.
I believe following your values, maintaining a strong moral compass,and spreading positivity are important spiritual aspects that I try to incorporate into my everyday life.
Ultimately, I am very satisfied with my life, and I am ecstatic to see what the future holds.
